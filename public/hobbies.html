<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
        <hr>

<h3>Brave heart</h3>
<p>It doesn't get any better than this. Mel Gibson 
    didn't just star in this movie but directed and produced. No one will ever forget...
    Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in 
    your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to 
    trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, 
    just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they 
    may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>The opening beach assault sequences were the most violent, realistic, 
    and upsetting filming I've ever seen; looked as though the thing 
    was actual combat footage. The shushing noises of rounds cutting 
    through the air was the most chilling part of all. Perfect portrayal of 
    the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most 
    foolish of enterprises. A must see.</p>

<h3>The Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: "Identity", 
    "Seven", "The Usual Suspects", etc., etc., etc. 
    I remember my friend being so obsessed with "Silence of the Lambs", 
    that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused 
    to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my 
    guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My friend was right, 
    this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. 
    I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and would recommend it to anyone. 
    It's creepy and exciting. Trust me, you'll love it.</p>
